None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body, we all die. But does that mean our lives are meaningless? Does that mean that there was no point in our being born? Would you say that of our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless?... They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The courageous fallen! The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning because we the living refuse to forget them! And as we ride to certain death, we trust our successors to do the same for us! Because my soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this world! My soldiers push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers RAAAAAGE!</p>

The longer you live, the more you realize that the only things that truly exist in this reality are merely pain, suffering and futility. Listen… Everywhere you look in this world, wherever there is light, there will always be shadows to be found as well. As long as there is a concept of victors, the vanquished will also exist. The selfish intent of wanting to preserve peace initiates wars and hatred is born in order to protect love. There are nexuses, causal relationships that cannot be separated. I want to sever the fate of this world. A world of only victors. A world of only peace. A world of only love. I will create such a world. I am…the ghost of the Uchihas. For truly this reality…is a hell.</p>

It makes no sense to beat someone when you're trying to negotiate for peace, especially since I just met you guys today. We don't know anything about each other. I have no grudges against you, so why do we have to fight? It's absurd. The only people who should be fighting are Kettle and King Canute, the leaders. They should be playing nephotopo, not us. We shouldn't be the ones settling their quarrel because there's absolutely no reason for this many people to shed their blood. Let's meet each other, and that means no one here is my enemy. Thank you, because I have no enemies.</p>
